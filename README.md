xplainable Multimodal Deep Learning System for Animal Emotion Recognition
A cutting-edge AI framework that combines audio, visual, and biometric data to recognize and explain animal emotions in real-time. Built with transformer-based models, multimodal fusion, and explainable AI (XAI) powered by GPT-4.

Overview
Animal emotion recognition is a growing field with applications in veterinary medicine, animal welfare, and human-animal interaction.
Traditional unimodal approaches (only audio or only images) often fail in noisy, dynamic environments.
This project introduces a multimodal deep learning system that integrates:

Audio (animal vocalizations) → Wav2Vec2 Transformer
Images (faces & body cues) → Vision Transformer (OpenCLIP ViT-B/32)
Biometrics (heart rate, temperature, variability) → Normalized numerical features
All modalities are fused using LSTM + Dense layers, producing robust emotion classification across 7 categories:
Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Relaxed, Curious, Neutral

To ensure transparency, predictions are explained in natural language using GPT-4.

Key Features
Multimodal Fusion: Audio + Image + Biometric integration
Transformer-based Feature Extraction: Wav2Vec2 & Vision Transformer
Interactive Visualization: Real-time emotion distribution via Chart.js pie charts
Explainable AI (XAI): GPT-4 generates human-readable explanations for predictions
Real-time Inference: Lightweight Flask REST API backend
Species Adaptability: Extendable to new animals, sensors, or contexts
